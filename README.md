1. No use of HTML tables
2. No in-line styles (e.g. no style tag, only CSS files)
3. No external libraries or snippets except:
   a. reset.css - eliminates browser inconsistencies with margin, padding,
   borders, and more.

## Special requirements:

1. Don’t include the outside frame (the tan border)
2. Should be able to resize the window and have the mondrian shrink/grow
3. Does not have to be EXACTLY proportional to the image (don’t bother
   counting/measuring pixels)
4. Utilize the same colors:
   a. Black: rgb(255,255,255)
   b. Red: rgb(255,56,1)
   c. Blue(ish): rgb(70,55,184)
   d. Yellow: rgb(255,202,0)
5. Google/MDN is allowed.
6. Create a checkbox that when selected makes 3 of the white blocks any
   shade of green.
7. Use mobile responsiveness to re-arrange the Mondrian appropriately.
